# Event Sourcing on Rails - Peer learning group

A fork of kickstarter's minimal event sourcing framework example app (based on their [blog post](https://kickstarter.engineering/event-sourcing-made-simple-4a2625113224)) for use with a peer learning group. At outset this repo contains

- Kickstarter's initial app
- Rspec for testing
- Rubocop config to pacify my text editor
- [Grape API](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape), initially with a single `POST /api/events` route.

This code is for educational purpose.
